# Problem Statement

Our Problem statement is to build a pixel-perfect Dermstore website clone. Previously I cloned two websites and some web pages but in this problem, we were supposed to make pages dynamic and responsive too.

## Idea

Since I'm pursuing a Full Stack Web Development course at Masai School I was given a project to clone **Dermstore ** which is a skincare and beauty e-commerce site in the United States. Since December 2020, it is a subsidiary of The Hut Group which is a British e-commerce company.  I was given a team of five members including me and the task was to clone the pixel-perfect clone of the website. Let's look at how we designed it ðŸ‘‡

## Dermstore Landing Page ðŸ‘‡ ðŸ’»
On the Home Page, there are many options like a search bar where users can search products by product name or Brand, then there is also an account option where users can log in or signup and beside it, a cart option is also there and by clicking on the cart option users can see the products which they have added to the cart.
users can also see new arrivals products and scroll through them just by clicking the buttons which are present on the left and right sides.


## About Project: 

## DermStore Link:- [DermStore](https://www.dermstore.com)

DermStore is a skin care and beauty e-commerce site in the United States.
It is one of the best places to find some of the highest quality skincare, makeup, haircare, and so much more for both women and men.

Since December 2020, it is a subsidiary of The Hut Group which is a British e-commerce company.

## OUR WORK :

We have tried to create as many features as we can of this website. Some of the pages and features which we created are :
Home Page, log In page, signUp page, sell page, add to cart, checkout page, functionality to add any product to cart page and displaying its details and total amount, functionality to scroll horizontally on the home page through buttons in various sections, functionality to get the product description if you click its image on all pages except for homepage and functionality to sort the products in some of the pages.
Here are some sample snippets of our cloned website.

## Team Work Efforts 

It is always taught to us that communication plays a great where it comes to group work. Our communication was so good that it enhanced our interest and motivated us to keep working in order to achieve the end result.

## Major Issue We Encountered :
1. We faced difficulties to manage the routes, page, dependencies to work at a time.
2. It was difficult for us to develop the carousel for our main page as it was not taught to us yet.
3. We encounter issues while pushing all our code to the master branch in git.
